% We used three classifications of amino acids with respect to their
% chemical property: (I) polarity and volume, (II) charge and aromaticity, and (III) charge and polarity (Table 1). Radical and conservative changes were defined as amino acid replacements between groups and within groups, respectively.

Table 1.

Chemical classification of amino acids by 3 kinds of chemical property
Classification I by polarity and volume
Special	C
Neutral and small	A G P S T
Polar and relatively small	N D Q E
Polar and relatively large	R H K
Nonpolar and relatively small	I L M V
Nonpolar and relatively large	F W Y

Classification II by charge and aromaticity
Acidic	D E
Neutral and no aromaticity	Q A V L I C S T N G P M
Neutral and aromaticity	F Y W
Basic	K R H

Classification III by charge and polarity
Neutral and polarity	S T Y C N Q
Acidic and polarity	D E
Basic and polarity	K R H
No polarity	G A V L I F P M W
